# Impact! API Documentation
What is Impact! API? Impact was made during the 2017 Hack UCSC event  in an attempt to build an API that could be very cross-platform and be able to filter inappropriate languages and output a positive message as a way to deter cyber bullies. 

#Getting Starting With Impact!

Impact is actually fairly simple to implement and will start by showing how to implement it as a stand alone html form file. From there it is up to the user to find different ways to use the API.
